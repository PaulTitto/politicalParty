      <p class="text-mission">
        As a nation we have so much potential, so much that we should be
        optimistic about. We can make Indonesian great again.
      </p>
      <p class="text-mission">
        To do this, reform is essential in the way our country is run and
        managed, so it works properly for the people. In many areas, just the
        application of basic common sense would be a good start!
      </p>
      <p class="text-mission">
        The nation faces many challenges, but we can overcome them. To succeed,
        we need to do Brexit properly. We must grow our way out of the crisis,
        we cannot tax our way out of it. We must stand up for our core
        democratic values, our civil liberties, our right to free speech.
      </p>
      <p class="text-mission">
        Let’s celebrate our pride in being British: our amazing culture, our
        unbreakable communities, our incredible heritage. Let’s stop all the
        woke nonsense that is holding us back. Let’s have a proper immigration
        policy that works for our country and protects our borders. Together,
        let’s make great things happen!

        <span
          >To succeed faster growth is vital. Higher growth rates are the only
          way to better wages and more tax revenues that can be invested in
          better healthcare and other public services. Our bold economic vision
          frees up over 6 million people from paying Income Tax and frees up
          over 1.2 million small businesses and self-employed from paying
          Corporation Tax. We would also aim to remove a raft of other stifling
          taxes in a responsible, timely way. This will generate much faster
          growth than seen in recent decades. We must also stop wasting
          taxpayers money.</span
