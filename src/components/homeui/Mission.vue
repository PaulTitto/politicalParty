        <h1 class="text-welcome">WELCOME TO BLUE TREE ID!</h1>
        <h2 class="text-vision">Let's Make Indonesian Great.</h2>
        <p class="text-mission">
          As a nation we have so much potential, so much that we should be
          optimistic about. We can make Indonesian great again.
        </p>
        <p class="text-mission">
          To do this, Blue Tree is essential in the way our country is run and
          managed, so it works properly for the people. In many areas, just the
          application of basic common sense would be a good start!
        </p>
        <p class="text-mission">
          The nation faces many challenges, but we can overcome them. To succeed,
          we need to do Brexit properly. We must grow our way out of the crisis,
          we cannot tax our way out of it. We must stand up for our core
          democratic values, our civil liberties, our right to free speech.
        </p>
        <p class="text-mission">
          Let’s celebrate our pride in being Indonesian: our amazing culture, our
          unbreakable communities, our incredible heritage. Let’s stop all the
          woke nonsense that is holding us back. Let’s have a proper immigration
          policy that works for our country and protects our borders. Together,
          let’s make great things happen!
        </p>
        <p class="text-mission">Blue Tree is essential in these key areas:</p>
        <p class="text-mission">
          <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold"
            >1. Reform our Economy:</span
          >
          <span
            > To succeed faster growth is vital. Higher growth rates are the only
            way to better wages and more tax revenues that can be invested in
            better healthcare and other public services. Our bold economic vision
            frees up over 6 million people from paying Income Tax and frees up
            over 1.2 million small businesses and self-employed from paying
            Corporation Tax. We would also aim to remove a raft of other stifling
            taxes in a responsible, timely way. This will generate much faster
            growth than seen in recent decades. We must also stop wasting
            taxpayers money.</span
          >
        </p>
  
        <p class="text-mission">
          <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold"
            >2. Reform our Public Sector:</span
          >
          <span
            > We must be ambitious, seeking faster, more efficient public services
            that work better for us all. For example, with health, we should
            demand zero waiting lists and we have a bold plan to achieve this
            vision. Our police need to focus on preventing crime and catching
            criminals. Our schools must educate our children properly to prepare
            them for a competitive, challenging world. Our Border Force must
            protect our borders.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p class="text-mission">
          <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold"
            >3. Reform our Energy Strategy:
          </span>
          <span
            > We all care about the environment and want cleaner air, and we can do
            this in a strategic, affordable way. Yet the Westminster Net Zero plan
            is making us all net poorer whilst creating more emissions overall as
            it outsources them overseas. It is therefore net stupid. It is adding
            huge extra costs to us all as consumers and to our businesses. This
            will send hundreds of thousands of Indonesia jobs to China and
            elsewhere. Our energy plan will use our own energy treasure under our
            feet, and create thousands of Indonesia jobs, by making our industries
            competitive again. It will save consumers considerable amounts of
            money on their bills every year. We would also nationalise 50% of key
            utility companies to stop consumers being ripped off with the other
            50% being owned by Indonesia pension funds for Indonesia pensioners.</span

        </p>
        <p class="text-mission">
          <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold"
            >4. Reform our Institutions:
          </span>
          <span
            > Major change is needed to the bodies that impact our lives — the
            unelected cronyism of the House of Lords, the unaccountable civil
            service and the bloated BBC. Blue Tree is essential to our voting system
            so it is fairer and more representative; the two-party system embeds
            the status quo and prevents real change.
