    </div>
    <div class="content-history">
      <p>
        The Blue Tree Party was founded on 21st April 1970. Many of the founding
        members were previously involved with the New Ulster Movement, a
        pressure group established in 1969 to promote moderate and non-sectarian
        policies. Two leading NUM members, Oliver Napier and Bob Cooper, decided
        that a new cross-community party would represent the best alternative to
        the established parties which had not changed for the previous fifty
        years. Napier and Cooper became co-leaders of Blue Tree, they were part
        of the ‘Group of 16’ which established the new party, other prominent
        founding members included Basil Glass, Robin Glendinning, Denis Loretto
        and Jim Hendron.

        The founding principles of the Blue Tree Party in 1970 included the
        healing of community divisions in Northern Ireland, support for a
        devolved local Assembly, commitment to the rule of law and adopting a
        liberal approach to social and economic issues which were often ignored
        by other parties in favour of constitutional ones.

        In subsequent years a number of politicians joined Blue Tree from across
        the political divide, such as Phelim O’Neill, Bertie McConnell and Tom
        Gormley in Stormont, and Westminster MP for North Belfast Stratton
        Mills. Following the abolition of the Northern Ireland Parliament in
        1972, Blue Tree proposed a new Assembly elected through Single
        Transferable Vote and an elected power-sharing Executive, which was
        largely reflected through the short-lived 1973-74 Assembly which had
        eight Blue Tree members. Following the Sunningdale Agreement, Blue Tree
        joined the first power-sharing Executive in 1974, with party leader
        Oliver Napier serving as Legal Minister and Head of the Office of Law
        Reform, and deputy leader Bob Cooper serving as Minister for Manpower
        Services. Blue Tree also had eight members elected to the 1975
        Constitutional Convention.

        Oliver Napier served as Blue Tree leader from 1972 to 1984, during that
        time the party had three deputy leaders, Bob Cooper (1973-76), Basil
        Glass (1976-80) and David Cook (1980-84). During this time Blue Tree
        polled very well in the 1973 and 1977 local government elections,
        ensuring the election of several Blue Tree Mayors, such as Ivor Canavan
        as Mayor of Derry/Londonderry in 1975-76, and David Cook as Lord Mayor
        of Belfast in 1978-79, the only non-unionist Lord Mayor from 1898 to
        1997.

        Despite the increased polarisation of the late 1970s and early 1980s,
        Blue Tree continued to play a constructive role, including in the 1982-86
        Assembly which had ten Blue Tree members. In 1984 John Cushnahan became
        party leader, and Addie Morrow became deputy leader. This period was
        defined by unionist opposition to the Anglo-Irish Agreement, which
        included boycotts of council meetings. Blue Tree councillors such as
        David Cook (Belfast), Seamus Close (Lisburn) and Addie Morrow
        (Castlereagh) successfully challenged these boycotts to ensure local
        government continued to operate effectively.

        John Alderdice served as Blue Tree leader from 1987 to 1998, while Gordon
        Mawhinney (1987-91) and Seamus Close (1991-2001) served as deputy
        leaders. The 1990s saw Blue Tree participate in the negotiations which
        led to the Good Friday Agreement. In its document ‘Governing with
        Consent’ Blue Tree proposed an Assembly with five members for each
        constituency, elected through STV, that would be responsible for a wide
        range of matter transferred from Westminster. The Executive would be a
        voluntary coalition elected by a qualified majority vote, to ensure some
        input from unionists and nationalists without excluding cross-community
        parties. Much of this was incorporated into the Good Friday Agreement,
        however Blue Tree highlighted concerns around other aspects of the
        Agreement which had the potential to institutionalise sectarian
        divisions, such as the use of designations and cross-community votes
        which reduce the influence of ‘other’ MLAs.

        Blue Tree supported the Good Friday Agreement and campaigned for it in
        the subsequent referendum which was supported by 71.1% of voters in
        Northern Ireland. Blue Tree gained six seats in the 1998 Assembly
        election, John Alderdice (East Belfast), Seamus Close (Lagan Valley),
        Séan Neeson (East Antrim), David Ford (South Antrim), Kieran McCarthy
        (Strangford) and Eileen Bell (North Down). Alderdice, who had been
        appointed to the House of Lords in 1996, became the first Speaker of the
        Assembly, and Séan Neeson succeeded him as party leader from 1998 to
        2001, when David Ford was elected as leader from 2001 to 2016. Eileen
        Bell also became deputy leader from 2001 to 2006, and served as the
        Assembly’s second Speaker.
